Our project focuses on COVID-19 mortaility by state over a time period. From our results, we aimed to:

1. Find significant factors that can affect the mortality of people due to COVID-19 across a set period of time
2. Create models and choose the best model that illustrates a linear relationship between mortality and determined important factors
3. Suggest state-specific or general "action items" based on these factors
