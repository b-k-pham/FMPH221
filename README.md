This class is the first out of three core courses of the first year Biostatistics Masters program at UCSD. At the end of the course, we had to create a project utilizing linear regression techniques that we had learned throughout the quarter to answer a scientific question of our choosing. This project was done in pairs of two.

Our project focuses on COVID-19 mortaility by state over a time period. From our results, we aimed to:

1. Find significant factors that can affect the mortality of people due to COVID-19 across a set period of time
2. Create models and choose the best model that illustrates a linear relationship between mortality and determined important factors
3. Suggest state-specific or general "action items" based on these factors
